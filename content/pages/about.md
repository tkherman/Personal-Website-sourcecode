My name is Herman and I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science in the
University of Notre Dame. I am originally from Hong Kong and came to Notre Dame
two years ago with an intend to major in Mechanical Engineering.

However, during my freshman year, I learned about programming for the first time
in the Intro to Engineering Class and was immediately fascinated by it. Going
into my Sophomore year, I decided to switch my major to computer science and
developed a passion for programming.
